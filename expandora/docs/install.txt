    Installation and Configation
    
    Pandora is based on following libs: 
    
	Qt (multithreaded), OpenGL, libxml, glibc. 
	
    Evetything else should be plain C/C++ 
    
    * download and unpack (is already done i guess)
    * cd src
    * qmake
    * make
    * read and edit /congifs/mume.conf
      
      Espectually note the ROOM COLOUR settings.
      Note: The give colour in this config is green. Pandora requires 
      unique colour for roomnames - this means you have to check if you
      use the green colour for anything else, like says tells emoutes etc.
      
    * add pandora's settings on top of your client settings. 
      (see /configs/pandora.pow)
    
    Watch out - you have to use full names for commands like north, east, look, 
    examine and scout. (see /configs/pandora.pow)
    
    * run the ./run file and check if the openGL and the program starts normally.
    
    * load your client and settings - try to connect to the localport.
    
    * read mhelp and mhelp command_name for each command :)
    
    
    Keys in OpenGL window:
    
    mouse, menu etc - as always.
    
    F12, F11, F10 			 - hide/show MENU bar, STATUS bar and 
					   ROOM info accordingly.
    
    left_mouse_button + mouse movements  - move the cam in x and y coordinates.
    
    right_mouse_button + mouse movements - change the x, y angles of view
    
    mouse_wheel 			 - change the Z coordinate
    
    PageUp/PageDown			 - rotate around the Z coordinate
    
    Escape 				 - reset the view/angle setting to 
					   default values.
    
    and for compatibility - older keys:
    
    q, w 				 - change the X coordinate       
    a, s 				 - change the Y coordinate
    y, x				 - change the Z coordinate
    
    r					 - force redraw (openGL/Qt message)
    c					 - force engine analyzer call 
					   (not used though)
    
    
    mhelp is your friend.
    mreset is your best friend - use it if ANY strange stuff starts to happen. :-)
