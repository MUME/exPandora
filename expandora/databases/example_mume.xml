    <desc>A low ridge rises by the stream, overlooking its course for many miles. Its|top looks mostly level, as if flattened by the abundant rains in the region|throughout countless years. However, there are small hollows and holes in the|rock, where dark water gathers in small ponds. Nevertheless, the crag bends|over the waters to the northwest, like a half-built bridge, or maybe merely|like a thick pillar of stone whose base has been thrashed by the troubled |waters of the river.|</desc>

    <desc>Around you is a lush forest at the foot of the Misty Mountains. Dew glistens|off the leaves above as well as ferns growing close to the ground. Birds |chirp happily and small animals are often seen scampering around. There are |some odd tracks here and there, and you can detect some feel of evil hanging|somewhere in the air. To the north is a really scaring forest, so dark than|no sun can reach the ground. To the south is a broad river leading to a |higher hill. From there, you ought to be able to get a good view of the|surrounding land.|</desc>
