    <desc>The road climbs ever upwards to the south, slowly and gently, but steadily. |Constant caretaking and repairs make sure the road is mostly in good shape, a|necessity for the trade and travel between Altdorf and the towns in the south.|On the east side of the road, some stocks, overgrown with weeds and moss, can|be seen lying in a pattern suggesting that once there was a building of some|sort here, maybe a tower to keep watch on the road.  |</desc>

A white stone of marble has been|erected on the southern side of the bridge, a memorial stone of sorts.  |</desc>

    <desc>Boulders the size of small houses force the Nuln road to take a sharp bend|eastwards, where the terrain is more open and accessible. These boulders would|most likely provide good shelter from wind and weather, at least were it to|blow from the southwest. Here and there, there are tracks of wagons leaving the|road moving towards the shelter of the boulders, most likely from where others|have made camp in the past when they were caught in the open by nightfall or|bad weather.  |</desc>
