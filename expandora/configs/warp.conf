# Automatic check for exits. Tunes the apply_exits comamnd (see engine.conf). If its off it skips the 
# stacks swap etc. Will be automatically turned off when you turn mapping on. Generally helps if you have
# a very detailed database. 
AutoCheckExits		no

# Automatic description check. Uses the approximate string matching. (see AutoRefresh section in this config file)
# Tunes the apply_desc command in engine. 
AutoCheckDesc		yes

# Automatic terrain check. Is highly connected with prompt and TerrainType section. 
AutoChechTerrain 	yes

# Mapper brief mode - this will enable fake brief mode. It cuts away all the descriptions. 
# ADVICE: add a gag in your config for the line 
# &1 is standing here, ridden by &2.
# The line is completely useless and just spams you when you play with brief mode off.
MapperBriefMode		yes

# Automatic merging in mapping mode. This this uses a special algorithm for deciding if 2 rooms
# are twins or not. In oldery areas (where all rooms have the same descs) ccthis is your worst enemy.
# Is also toggleable by mautomerge command while playing/mapping. 
AutoMerge	on

# automatic database refresh system. This gives engine 10% of allowed mistakes in roomname (a little bit special)
# description. DescSimilarityQuote 10 would allow 10% of char to be misplace, removed, or changed to other chars.
