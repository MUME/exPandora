# General config file for Pandora.
# This is a config file for MUME.
#

#
# General notes. 
# * Try not to use comments after config lines like
#   RemoteHost fire.pvv.org # this is my game port!
#   This _MIGHT_ lead to malfunction in some cases. Normally it wont, though.
# 
# * Boolean values are : yes/no, 1/0, true/false, on/off, +/-
#
# * This config line override hard coded defaults. Command line options
#   override both of them.
#



# local port for incoming connections. This is the port you will have to use in your client.
# Default hardcoded value is 3000. 
LocalPort 	3000

# Remote Port - game port. Default hardcoded value is 4242. 
RemotePort 	4242

# Remote Host - game hostname (or ip as in this example). 
# Default hardcoded value is warpmud.org. (hihi)
RemoteHost 	mume.pvv.org

# The database to load. Default is 'base.xml'. 
baseFile 	./databases/example_mume.xml

# This defines the ansi sequences for roomname. Not that this must be unique
# colour in your in-game setup. This mean tells, emotes, hits/damage etc should
# use some different colour. 
# (!) Take care with the 'escape' charecter - the first one in sequence.
#     in some editors its hard to get this char in.
# Ahh yes - the first token is the colour-start sequence and the second is the closing (terminating) sequence.
# just in case. - most likelly you will only need to change the number. 
# 32 - is the non-bold green.
RoomColour	[32m	[0m

# Exits pattern. 
ExitsPattern	Exits:

# Renderer Performance settings. Sets the range for detailed rendering. Textures wont be 
# applied if the distance to room is > then given number. 
TexturesVisibilityRange 500

# details is connections, doors, deathtrap markers etc. This takes most CPU time for redrawing
DetailsVisibilityRange   400

# Automatic check for exits. Tunes the apply_exits comamnd (see engine.conf). If its off it skips the 
# stacks swap etc. Will be automatically turned off when you turn mapping on. Generally helps if you have
# a very detailed database. 
AutoCheckExits		no

# Automatic description check. Uses the approximate string matching. (see AutoRefresh section in this config file)
# Tunes the apply_desc command in engine. 
AutoCheckDesc		yes

# Automatic terrain check. Is highly connected with prompt and TerrainType section. 
AutoChechTerrain 	yes

# Mapper brief mode - this will enable fake brief mode. It cuts away all the descriptions. 
# ADVICE: add a gag in your config for the line 
# &1 is standing here, ridden by &2.
# The line is completely useless and just spams you when you play with brief mode off.
MapperBriefMode		yes

# Automatic merging in mapping mode. This this uses a special algorithm for deciding if 2 rooms
# are twins or not. In oldery areas (where all rooms have the same descs) ccthis is your worst enemy.
# Is also toggleable by mautomerge command while playing/mapping. 
AutoMerge	on

# AngryLinker tries to automatically link the rooms. It does the coordinates check and if 2 rooms 
# are 2 units away from each other and have opposite undefined exits - it will automatically link them.
# this takes a full ccle over ALL rooms in your base ever time you add a room. SO - it MIGHT be SLOW.
# AND it might also link the rooms you do NOT want to link. So take care. Though this feature is VERY 
# useful in old 10 x 10 zones like the zone s of bree. And in any other 10x 10 zones as well. 
# But -  watch out. 
AngryLinker	off

# automatic database refresh system. This gives engine 10% of allowed mistakes in roomname (a little bit special)
# description. DescSimilarityQuote 10 would allow 10% of char to be misplace, removed, or changed to other chars. 
AutoRefresh	on
RoomNameSimilarityQuote	10

# Movement failures.
# Syntax : MovementFailure <one word long description/identifier> <The in-game line to catch>
# This generates the appropriate R_FAIL event in engine system with data set to your identifier.

MovementFailure boat		Your boat cannot enter this place.


# Terrains and textures setup.
# Take care with both textures and identifiers you setup.
# Syntax: TerrainType <description> <path to the texture> <prompt ID for the terrain>
# Notes: 
# * Description is also used for XML database. SO do not change it without a reason and 
#   be sure you update your database in according way.
#
# * Path to texture and texture name are not allowed to have white spaces in it. This will
#   cause a malfunction. (the part after white space, tab etc will be interpreted as prompt
#   ID).
#
# * Try to track prompt ID updates in-game. In the time of development it was changed once.
#   Without any notes/news or anything similar from the game management as always.
